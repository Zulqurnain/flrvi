# FLRVI - Testing Strategy

**Objective:** This document defines the testing strategy for the FLRVI project, covering the backend, web frontends, and mobile application. The goal is to ensure a high-quality, stable, and reliable product.

### 1. Testing Philosophy

*   **Quality is a Team Responsibility:** Every member of the development team is responsible for quality.
*   **Automate Everything Possible:** We will prioritize automated testing to ensure consistency and speed.
*   **Test Early, Test Often:** Testing will be an integral part of the development process, not an afterthought.
*   **Focus on the User:** Our testing efforts will be guided by the user journeys and acceptance criteria defined in the PRD.

### 2. Levels of Testing

We will employ a multi-layered testing approach, often referred to as the "Testing Pyramid."

#### 2.1. Unit Tests
*   **Objective:** To test individual functions and components in isolation.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Jest
    *   **Scope:** Test controller logic, utility functions, and individual middleware functions. We will use mocking for database and external API calls.
*   **Mobile App (React Native):**
    *   **Framework:** Jest with React Native Testing Library
    *   **Scope:** Test individual UI components (e.g., buttons, inputs), Redux reducers, and utility functions.

#### 2.2. Integration Tests
*   **Objective:** To test the interaction between different parts of the system.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Jest with Supertest
    *   **Scope:** Test API endpoints to ensure they correctly interact with the database and middleware. We will use an in-memory MongoDB server for these tests.
*   **Mobile App (React Native):**
    *   **Framework:** Jest with React Native Testing Library
    *   **Scope:** Test screen components to ensure they correctly interact with the Redux store and API services.

#### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
*   **Objective:** To simulate real user scenarios from start to finish.
*   **Mobile App (React Native):**
    *   **Framework:** Detox or Appium
    *   **Scope:** Automate key user journeys, such as:
        1.  User registration and login.
        2.  Creating and editing a profile.
        3.  Searching for a user and sending a message.
        4.  Upgrading to a premium subscription.

### 3. Performance Testing

*   **Objective:** To ensure the backend can handle the expected user load and the app remains responsive.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Tool:** JMeter or k6
    *   **Scope:** Load test critical API endpoints (e.g., user search, profile loading) to measure response times under pressure.
*   **Mobile App:**
    *   **Tool:** React Native's built-in performance monitoring tools (e.g., Flipper).
    *   **Scope:** Profile the app's performance to identify and fix any bottlenecks in rendering or business logic.

### 4. Manual & User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

*   **Objective:** To catch issues that are difficult to automate and to validate the app against user expectations.
*   **Process:** Before each major release, we will conduct a round of manual testing based on the user journeys.
*   **UAT:** A small group of beta testers will be invited to use the app and provide feedback before the public launch.

### 5. Continuous Integration (CI)

*   **Platform:** GitHub Actions
*   **Workflow:** On every push to the main branch, the CI pipeline will automatically:
    1.  Install dependencies.
    2.  Run linters and formatters.
    3.  Execute all unit and integration tests.
    4.  Build the application.
*   A successful CI run will be a prerequisite for any deployment.
