# FLRVI - Go-to-Market & Launch Plan

**Objective:** This document outlines the strategy for launching the FLRVI application to the public, acquiring our first users, and monitoring the app's performance post-launch.

### 1. Pre-Launch Phase (Now - 1 Month Before Launch)

*   **Objective:** To build awareness and generate a list of potential early adopters.
*   **Key Activities:**
    1.  **Landing Page:** Drive traffic to the `flrvi.com` pre-registration page that we have already built.
    2.  **Social Media Campaign:**
        *   Create social media profiles for FLRVI on platforms popular in Thailand (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, TikTok).
        *   Run a targeted ad campaign aimed at our defined target audience (20-45, in Thailand).
        *   Post engaging content related to dating and relationships in Thailand.
    3.  **Influencer Outreach:** Collaborate with Thai influencers in the lifestyle and dating space to promote the app to their followers.
    4.  **App Store Optimization (ASO):** Prepare our App Store and Google Play Store listings with high-quality screenshots, a compelling description, and relevant keywords (in both English and Thai).

### 2. Launch Phase (Launch Week)

*   **Objective:** To successfully launch the app on the App Store and Google Play Store and drive a surge of initial downloads.
*   **Key Activities:**
    1.  **Submit to App Stores:** Submit the final app builds for review at least one week before the planned launch date.
    2.  **"Go Live" Announcement:**
        *   Send an email to our pre-registration list announcing that the app is now available.
        *   Coordinate with influencers for a synchronized launch-day promotion.
        *   Publish "Now Live" posts on all social media channels.
    3.  **Press Outreach:** Send a press release to local tech and lifestyle publications in Thailand.
    4.  **Initial User Support:** Have a dedicated support channel (e.g., a specific email address) ready to handle user feedback and bug reports.

### 3. Post-Launch Phase (First 3 Months)

*   **Objective:** To monitor the app's performance, gather user feedback, and iterate on the product.
*   **Key Activities:**
    1.  **Performance Monitoring:**
        *   **Analytics:** Use a tool like Firebase Analytics to track our key success metrics (downloads, user activation, engagement, monetization).
        *   **Crash Reporting:** Use a tool like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics to monitor for and quickly fix any bugs.
    2.  **User Feedback Loop:**
        *   Actively monitor app store reviews and social media comments.
        *   Send out in-app surveys to gather feedback from active users.
    3.  **Community Management:**
        *   Engage with users on social media.
        *   Actively moderate the platform to ensure it remains a safe and respectful community, as per our `content_strategy.md`.
    4.  **Iterative Development:**
        *   Use the feedback and data we've gathered to prioritize the next set of features for version 1.1.
        *   Plan for a regular release cycle (e.g., a new update every 4-6 weeks).

This launch plan provides a clear roadmap for taking FLRVI from a finished product to a thriving application in the hands of users.
