# FLRVI - Monetization Strategy

**Objective:** This document outlines the monetization strategy for the FLRVI application. The primary goal is to generate sustainable revenue while maintaining a positive user experience for both free and paying users.

### 1. Core Philosophy

*   **Value-Driven:** Premium features should offer clear and compelling value that enhances the user's ability to make meaningful connections.
*   **Freemium Model:** The core functionality of the app (creating a profile, browsing users, and limited messaging) will be free. This will allow us to build a large user base, which is essential for a dating app's success.
*   **Transparency:** Pricing and the benefits of a premium subscription will be communicated clearly and honestly to the user.

### 2. Subscription Tiers (MVP)

For the initial launch, we will offer a single, simple premium subscription tier called **FLRVI Premium**.

*   **Pricing:**
    *   **Monthly:** 299 THB / month (recurring subscription).
    *   We will also offer discounted packages for longer commitments (e.g., 3 months, 6 months) to increase the customer lifetime value (LTV).
*   **Feature Gating:**
    *   **Free Tier:**
        *   Create and manage a full profile.
        *   Browse all user profiles.
        *   Use basic search filters (age, gender).
        *   Send **one** introductory message to any user.
    *   **FLRVI Premium Tier:**
        *   **Unlimited Messaging:** Send and receive unlimited messages.
        *   **Advanced Search Filters:** Access to premium filters like location, interests, and "online now."
        *   **See Who Likes You:** View a list of all users who have liked your profile.
        *   **Read Receipts:** See when your messages have been read by the other user.
        *   **Ad-Free Experience:** The app will be free of any third-party advertisements.

### 3. Future Monetization Opportunities (Post-MVP)

As the app grows, we can explore additional revenue streams to complement the core subscription model.

*   **Consumable In-App Purchases:**
    *   **"Boosts":** Allow users to pay a small fee to have their profile featured at the top of the search results for a limited time (e.g., 30 minutes).
    *   **"Super Likes":** A special type of "like" that is more prominent and sends a direct notification to the recipient. Users could get a limited number for free and purchase more.
*   **Tiered Subscriptions:**
    *   Introduce a higher-tier subscription (e.g., **FLRVI Gold**) with exclusive features like:
        *   One free "Boost" per month.
        *   The ability to see who has read your profile.
        *   Advanced privacy controls.
*   **Partnerships:**
    *   Collaborate with local businesses in Thailand (e.g., restaurants, cafes, event organizers) to offer exclusive deals and discounts to FLRVI users for their dates.

### 4. Payment Gateway

*   **Primary:** Omise will be our primary payment gateway, with a focus on seamless integration of Thai QR code payments.
*   **Standard In-App Purchases:** We will also integrate with the native Apple App Store and Google Play Store payment systems to comply with their policies and provide a familiar checkout experience for users.

This monetization strategy provides a clear path to revenue while ensuring the app remains accessible and valuable to a broad audience.
