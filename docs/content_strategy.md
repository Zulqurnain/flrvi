# FLRVI - Content Strategy Guide

**Objective:** This document outlines the content strategy for the FLRVI app, including the official tone of voice and guidelines for user-generated content.

### 1. Tone of Voice

The FLRVI brand voice should be:

*   **Friendly & Welcoming:** We want users to feel comfortable and at ease. The language should be inclusive and encouraging.
*   **Playful & Fun:** Dating should be enjoyable. We will use a lighthearted and positive tone, with occasional use of emojis where appropriate.
*   **Respectful & Trustworthy:** While playful, we must also be respectful. The tone should convey a sense of security and a commitment to user safety.
*   **Clear & Simple:** All copy, from button text to notifications, should be easy to understand. We will avoid jargon and complex sentences.

**Examples:**
*   **Good:** "Welcome to FLRVI! Let's create your profile and find your connection."
*   **Bad:** "User registration initiated. Please complete the required fields to proceed."

### 2. In-App Copy

*   **Onboarding:** The onboarding process should feel like a friendly conversation, guiding the user step-by-step.
*   **Error Messages:** Error messages should be helpful and reassuring, not alarming. They should explain what went wrong in simple terms and suggest a solution.
*   **Notifications:** Push notifications should be engaging and provide clear value, encouraging users to return to the app without being spammy.

### 3. User-Generated Content Guidelines

To maintain a safe and positive community, we will enforce the following guidelines for all user-generated content (profiles, bios, messages):

*   **Be Respectful:** No harassment, bullying, hate speech, or any form of discrimination will be tolerated.
*   **Be Authentic:** Users must be who they say they are. No impersonation or catfishing.
*   **Keep it Clean:** No nudity, sexually explicit content, or graphic violence.
*   **No Commercial Activity:** FLRVI is for personal connections, not for promoting businesses, selling products, or soliciting.
*   **One Person, One Account:** Each user is allowed only one account to maintain the integrity of the community.

### 4. Content Moderation

*   **Reporting Tools:** Users will have an easy-to-access "Report" button on every profile and in every chat.
*   **Automated Filtering:** We will implement automated filters to detect and block inappropriate language and images.
*   **Human Review:** All reported content will be reviewed by a human moderation team within 24 hours.
*   **Enforcement:** Violations of the guidelines will result in a warning, temporary suspension, or permanent ban, depending on the severity of the offense.

This content strategy will help us build a strong brand identity and a thriving, respectful community for FLRVI.
