# FLRVI - Error Handling & Messaging Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-08-09

**Objective:** This document defines a consistent and user-friendly strategy for handling and displaying errors across the FLRVI web and mobile applications.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles

*   **Clarity:** Error messages should be written in simple, human-readable language, avoiding technical jargon.
*   **Helpfulness:** Whenever possible, an error message should tell the user how to fix the problem.
*   **Gracefulness:** The UI should handle errors gracefully, without crashing or creating a confusing user experience.
*   **Consistency:** The presentation and tone of error messages should be consistent across the entire platform.

## 2. Categories of Errors & UX Patterns

We will categorize errors to handle them with the appropriate UX pattern.

### 2.1. Input Validation Errors
*   **Description:** Occur when a user enters invalid data into a form field (e.g., an invalid email format).
*   **UX Pattern:**
    *   Display a concise, inline error message directly below the relevant input field.
    *   The input field's border should turn to the `system.error` color (`#F44336`).
    *   The "Submit" button should be disabled until all validation errors are resolved.
*   **Example Message:** "Please enter a valid email address."

### 2.2. Non-Blocking API Errors
*   **Description:** Occur when a non-critical API request fails in the background (e.g., failing to update a user's "last active" status).
*   **UX Pattern:**
    *   **Silent Failure:** These errors should fail silently without interrupting the user.
    *   **Logging:** The error should be logged to our monitoring service (e.g., Sentry) for developers to investigate.
    *   No UI change is necessary.

### 2.3. Blocking API Errors
*   **Description:** Occur when a critical API request fails, preventing the user from completing their current task (e.g., failing to send a message).
*   **UX Pattern:**
    *   **Toast/Snackbar Notification:** A non-intrusive toast or snackbar notification should appear at the top or bottom of the screen.
    *   The notification should contain a brief, clear message explaining the error.
    *   It should automatically dismiss after a few seconds.
*   **Example Message:** "Could not send message. Please try again."

### 2.4. Full Screen Errors
*   **Description:** Occur when a screen's primary data fails to load, leaving the screen in an unusable state.
*   **UX Pattern:**
    *   Display a full-screen error state, as defined in `docs/app_screens_json/31_home_screen_states.json`.
    *   This state should include a clear error message and a "Retry" button to allow the user to attempt the action again.
*   **Example Message:** "We couldn't load profiles right now. Please check your connection and try again."

### 2.5. Critical System Errors
*   **Description:** A rare, unexpected error that prevents the app from functioning correctly (e.g., a fatal crash).
*   **UX Pattern:**
    *   **Crash Reporting:** The app should automatically report the crash to our monitoring service (e.g., Sentry) with detailed logs.
    *   **Graceful Restart:** The app should attempt to restart gracefully. If it fails multiple times, it should display a message asking the user to restart the app manually.

## 3. Error Message Tone & Style

*   **Tone:** Reassuring, helpful, and aligned with our brand voice (as defined in the `Content Strategy Guide`).
*   **Localization:** All error messages displayed to the user must be translatable and will have entries in our `en.json` and `th.json` files.

This comprehensive error handling strategy will ensure that we provide a professional and resilient user experience, even in the face of unexpected issues.
