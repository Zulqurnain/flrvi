# FLRVI - Security Best Practices

**Objective:** This document outlines the security best practices and measures that will be implemented throughout the development and operation of the FLRVI application to protect user data and ensure a secure platform.

### 1. Guiding Principles

*   **Security by Design:** Security will be a core consideration from the start of the development process, not an afterthought.
*   **Defense in Depth:** We will implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against a wide range of threats.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** All components of the system will only have the permissions necessary to perform their intended functions.

### 2. Authentication & Session Management

*   **Password Security:**
    *   All user passwords will be hashed using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (`bcryptjs`).
    *   We will enforce minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., 8 characters, including a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols).
*   **JWT Security:**
    *   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) will be signed using a strong, secret key (`JWT_SECRET`).
    *   JWTs will have a short expiration time (e.g., 1 hour) to limit the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
    *   We will implement a refresh token mechanism for a seamless and secure user experience.
*   **Brute Force Protection:** We will implement rate limiting on the login endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks.

### 3. Data Security

*   **Data in Transit:** All communication between the mobile app, web frontends, and the backend server will be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
*   **Data at Rest:** Sensitive user data in the MongoDB database will be encrypted.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   All data received from clients (API requests) will be strictly validated on the backend to prevent common vulnerabilities like NoSQL injection.
    *   We will use a library like `Zod` or `express-validator` for this purpose.
*   **Output Encoding:** All data sent to the frontend will be properly encoded to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### 4. API Security

*   **Secure Endpoints:** All API endpoints that handle sensitive data or actions will be protected and require a valid JWT.
*   **Authorization:** In addition to authentication, we will implement proper authorization checks. For example, a user should only be able to edit their own profile, not someone else's.
*   **CORS Configuration:** The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy will be configured to only allow requests from our trusted domains (e.g., `flrvi.com`).

### 5. Secure Development Lifecycle

*   **Dependency Scanning:** We will use a tool like `npm audit` or Snyk to regularly scan our project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   No secret keys, passwords, or API tokens will ever be hardcoded in the source code.
    *   All secrets will be managed through environment variables (`.env` file for local development, and secure config management for production).
*   **Regular Security Audits:** We will conduct periodic security reviews of the codebase to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

### 6. User Privacy

*   **Data Minimization:** We will only collect the user data that is absolutely necessary for the functioning of the app.
*   **Privacy Policy:** A clear and easy-to-understand privacy policy will be made available to all users.
*   **User Data Deletion:** When a user deletes their account, all of their personal data will be permanently removed from our systems.

By implementing these security best practices, we will build a platform that our users can trust.
